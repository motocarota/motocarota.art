![Simone Poggi](/me.png) 

My name is Simone Poggi, and I'm the author of Another One Quest to Dust a medieval sword-and-sorcery journey through our endless imaginary travels in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. 

My current main work is [freelance frontend developer](https://simone-poggi.com/) that allows me to deliver all my creativity in my comics without the fear of starving out.

While not bashing my head against computer screens I spend my time with my wife, my cat and two beautiful nasty kids, in Italy.
