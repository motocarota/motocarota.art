# README

based on https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/

in order to update github pages you need to manually build, commit and push the `/docs` folder.

I have prepared the `npm run deploy` command to do so.

# development

  npm run dev

# build

  npm run build

# deploy

  npm run deploy
