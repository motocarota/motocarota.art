![Simone Poggi](/me.png) 

My name is Simone Poggi, and I'm the author of Another One Quest to Dust a medieval sword-and-sorcery journey through our endless imaginary travels in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. 

I work as freelance and my skills range from illustration to comic arts and web development.

While not bashing my head against computer screens I spend my time with my wife, my cat and two beautiful nasty kids, in Italy.
